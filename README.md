# GC-neuron-response-classification
Implementations for classifiying neural responses in the gustatory cortex of mice according to different intraoral stimuli.

This repository contains the implementations and figures in the paper _Cortical Coding of Gustatory and Thermal Signals in Active Licking Mice_ by Audrey N Nash, Morgan Shakeshaft, Cecilia G. bouaichi, Katherine E. Odegaard, Tom Needham, Martin Bauer, Richard Bertram, and Roberto Vincis. This paper is available on BioArxiv at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.27.591293v2, has been accepted to the _Journal of Physiology_ and is pending review.
