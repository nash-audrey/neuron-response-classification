# neuron-response-classification
Implementations for classifiying neural responses in the gustatory cortex of mice according to different intraoral stimuli.

This repository contains the implementations and figures in the paper _Cortical Coding of Gustatory and Thermal Signals in Active Licking Mice_ by Audrey N Nash, Morgan Shakeshaft, Cecilia G. bouaichi, Katherine E. Odegaard, Tom Needham, Martin Bauer, Richard Bertram, and Roberto Vincis. This paper is available on BioArxiv at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.27.591293v2, has been accepted to the _Journal of Physiology_ and is pending review.

This material is based upon work supported in part by the NSF under grant DMS2324962, grant number R01 DC-019326 from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and grant number T32 DC000044.



### Notes:
Keep in mind that as you change the stimuli, all that is necessary is to change the original dataframes neuronDF and LickDF that you import into the first notebook (01- Bayesian Coding Neuron Classification). Instructions for modifying the code in order to classify different numbers of stimuli are included in the comments/ markdown text in that file.
